[RiotJS](https://github.com/riot/riot) startkit, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and  [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts).

Package included simple app example, webpack dev server with *riot hot reload* and less, sass, stylus support. ES6 features available too.
Jest with riot support for testing. ES6 and eslint in riot tag.

Just read https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app but replace all "react" word to "riot" :)
