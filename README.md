[RiotJS](https://github.com/riot/riot) startkit, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and  [custom-react-scripts](https://github.com/kitze/custom-react-scripts).

Package included simple app example, webpack dev server with riot-loader and less,sass,stylus,css-components support. ES6 features available too.

Just read https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app but replace all "react" word to "riot" :)

git clone https://github.com/alexstep/create-riot-app-ejected my-riot-app

### ‚úé Configuration options

Modify the ```.env``` file in the root of the generated project, and add any of the configuration options below üëá to enable that feature.

The generated project comes with SASS, LESS, and CSS modules support by default, but you can remove them at any time by removing the options from the ```.env``` file.

#### Styling
- ```enable_less=true``` - enable LESS support
- ```enable_sass=true``` - enable SASS support
- ```enable_stylus=true``` - enable Stylus support


#### Others
- ```PORT=9999``` - change default port (supported in CRA by default)
- ```OPEN_BROWSER=false``` - don't open browser after running webpack server
